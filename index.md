# The Vision
Imaginaide tries to bridge the gap between abstraction and understanding. We hope to empower individuals to grasp the magnitude of the numbers that underpin the quantitative workings of our world.

# The Probem
To truly understand the numbers we come across in everyday life can be a daunting task. If you were shown 3 dice, you could probably immediately tell there were three.
