# The Vision
Imaginaide tries to bridge the gap between abstraction and understanding. We hope to empower individuals to grasp the magnitude of the numbers that underpin the quantitative workings of our world.

# The Probem
To truly understand the numbers we come across in everyday life can be a daunting task. If you were shown 3 dice, you could probably immediately tell there were three. However, if you were presented with 10 dice, chances are you'd have to count them to see how many there are. Usually, the bigger the number, the more it is a mere notional concept. After all, what does it mean to have 100 billion dollars, emit 100 kilograms of carbon dioxide or consume 100 kilocalories of food?

# The Solution
Imaginaide provides tangible and visual comparisons to entered quantities, thereby giving real meaning to abstract numbers. 100 billion dollars seems certainly less mistifying when you know it could buy you 6 Gerald R. Ford-class aircraft carriers or 10 Hubble Space Telescopes...
